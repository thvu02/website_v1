I am a 4th year undergraduate Computer Science and Engineering student in the [<u>Henry Samueli School of Engineering</u>](https://samueli.ucla.edu/) at 
[<u>UCLA</u>](https://www.ucla.edu/). I love computer science for its unlimited application potential and hope to leverage my skills towards societal betterment and forging a more equitable world.

As a first-generation, Vietnamese American student who lacked the programming experience and familial support in engineering that my peers had, I noticed the inequities in CS at UCLA (and in general). Therefore, in my last year at UCLA, I intend to use my leadership positions to make CS at UCLA more equitable by provind more opportunities and resources to those from underserved and underrepresented backgrounds. At the moment, I'm working with the CS Department to bring more companies to UCLA so our students have access to more job opportunities.

In my free time, I learn new languages/frameworks by working on various side projects (like this website) and dive deeper into machine learning as well as Internet of Things. When I need a break from academics, I enjoy spending time with friends, trying food from different cultures, bowling, playing Valorant, learning to dance, and watching cooking videos.

I'm a Computer Science Master's student at [Cal Poly Pomona](https://www.cpp.edu/) and recent graduate from [UCLA](https://samueli.ucla.edu/) where I got my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Engineering. My interests lie in machine learning, cybersecurity, software engineering, and internet of things. I love computer science for its unlimited application potential and hope to leverage my skills towards societal betterment and forging a more equitable world.

So far, I've driven towards this goal in many ways. I've worked on projects dedicated towards combating climate change through internships at startups and [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/). At the same time, I worked to make UCLA a more equitable environment. As a first-generation, Vietnamese American student who lacked the programming experience and familial support in engineering many of my peers had, I noticed the inequities in CS at UCLA. I leveraged my leadership positions to advocate for more opportunities and resources for those from underserved and underrepresented backgrounds. I also used my tutoring and Teaching Assistant positions to bring about equity in the classroom by helping struggling students catch up to their peers.

Now, I'm working towards ensuring national security through my internship at [Sandia National Laboratories](https://www.sandia.gov/) and I'm collaborating with medical researchers at [Western University of Health Sciences](https://www.westernu.edu/) to revolutionize drug discovery with AI.

I'm usually quite busy, but in my free time, I learn new languages/frameworks by working on various side projects and dive deeper into ML, cybersecurity, and IoT. When I need a break from academics, I enjoy spending time with friends, eating out, bowling, playing Valorant, learning to dance, and watching anime.

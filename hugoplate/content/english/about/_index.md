I am a 4th year undergraduate Computer Science and Engineering student in the [<u>Henry Samueli School of Engineering</u>](https://samueli.ucla.edu/) at 
[<u>UCLA</u>](https://www.ucla.edu/). I love computer science for its unlimited application potential and hope to leverage my skills to help forge a more equitable world.
In my last year at UCLA, I hope to use my positions to make CS at UCLA more equitable and bring more companies to UCLA so our students have access to more opportunities.

In my free time, I learn new languages/frameworks by working on various side projects (like this website) and dive deeper into Internet of Things. When I need a break from academics, I enjoy spending time with friends, trying food from different cultures, bowling, playing Valorant, learning to dance, and watching cooking videos.

### Currently, I am...

Interning at [<u>Sandia National Laboratories</u>](https://www.sandia.gov/)

Researching with [<u>Scalable Analytics Institute</u>](https://scai.cs.ucla.edu/)

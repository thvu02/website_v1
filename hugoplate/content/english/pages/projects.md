My own website created with Hugo and TailwindCSS using an open-source template and hosted on GitHub Pages.

Creating a personal website is not only great for marketing, but it's also just great for getting more expereince with different languages and frameworks quickly. I became interested in building a website after my intern buddy, Mihir, convinced me to buy a custom domain. I bought the domain through Google Domains for $12/yr (and hope it'll stay at that price), but since Squarespace acquired Google Domains in Sep 2023, I don't know if they'll mark up the price. Anyways, I didn't want to create the website from scratch because I have no artistic/design ability, so I looked for a template to use. I went through two templates from two of the most popular static site generators, [Jeykll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Hugo,](https://gohugo.io/) and found a nice template on Hugo. There are tradeoffs to using either Jekyll or Hugo, but both are easy to get into and for my purposes, the tradeoffs aren't a big deal. This [article](https://draft.dev/learn/hugo-vs-jekyll) sums up the tradeoffs quite well.

One of the pros of using a template is that you don't need to develop from scratch. That being said, one of the cons is you are given a large codebase with lots of files you don't understand. The template I found was nice, but it didn't have lots of documentation on how to use it. I was adding/deleting code here and there to slowly figure out what was connected to what, but I ultimately decided to do some tutorials and learn how Hugo worked. The tutorials by [Magsther](https://medium.com/@magstherdev/github-pages-hugo-86ae6bcbadd) and [4BES.NL](https://4bes.nl/2021/08/29/create-a-website-with-hugo-and-github-pages/) were quite helpful. With that, I became modifying the template to fit my needs and got my website up and running. I hosted it on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) because its free. GitHub Pages automatically builds your site when you push changse to your repo, so that created less hassle for me. To serve my site from my custom domain rather than GitHub's default of user_name.github.io, I modified the repo settings and also did some configuration on Google Domains. This [GitHub article](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site) summarizes the process quite well.

After 2 weeks of having the website, I got bored of the template and it's lack of flexibility, so I moved to a different template called [Hugoplate](https://github.com/zeon-studio/hugoplate). This one had more documentation, support, and flexibility. By modifying certain files, I fit the website to my needs. More specifically, I modified .html files to add more buttons on the homepage so I can link both my resume and CV. I also modified .scss files to prevent overflow text in the Experience page from being clipped. This was actually quite fun because on top of learning how scss worked, I had to use inspect element to figure out how the classname of the parts I wanted to modify the styling of. Beyond this, I modified various .md, .json, and .toml files to change the site layout and add my personal information.

I don't think there's going to be a point where I just stop improving/developing this website. There's a lot I want to do with it such as utilizing the Blog page. Also, my resume and CV change practically every month, so I need to come back and update links anyways. But yeah, I strongly encourage people to build a personal website. It's fun, useful, and also a cool flex!

This project was done in collaboration with my buddies [Annie Xiang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anniexiang01/) and [Nathan Nguyendinh.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathan-nguyendinh/) We created a 2-player game called PONG!. The game was programmed using Verilog through Xilinx ISE and is displayed on a VGA monitor while the scoreboard is displayed on the seven-segment display of the DE10-LITE FPGA. In this game, players compete against each other using paddles to hit a ball into the opponentâ€™s goal. The ball bounces off the top and bottom sides of the VGA monitor. Each player has two buttons to move their paddle up and down. If a player lets the ball enter their goal, the current round ends with the opposing player gaining a point. Both players play up until one player gets 5 points or the game is reset using the RESET button.

The game is displayed on a VGA monitor and starts upon pressing the START button. Before the START button is pressed, a color gradient is displayed as the start screen. Upon starting the game, two paddles appear on the right and left of the screen and a ball appears in the center of the screen, moving towards a player. Additionally, a scoreboard appears on the seven-segment display starting with 0 points for each player. Player 1 and player 2 can each move their respective paddle using the buttons on external button modules. Each player has a button to move their paddle up, and another button to move their paddle down.

The players compete to bounce the ball with the paddle alternatingly and have their opponent miss the ball. Each time the ball is hit, its speed will increase until it reaches a maximum speed which it will then sustain. The round ends when one player misses the ball and it hits their side (i.e. Player 1 misses the ball and it hits anywhere on the left side of the screen). The player who misses the ball and lets it pass through their side loses the round. When a round ends, the scoreboard updates, giving 1 point to the winner and 0 points to the loser.

A new round starts with the ball appearing in the center of the screen and moving towards a player. The game will continue until a player gets 5 points, in which the game will go back to the start screen. At any point in the game, a player can push the RESET button to restart the game and scoreboard at any point and time, going back to the start screen and setting both scores back to zero.

The Fitness Form Protection Tool is my first personal project. It is an Internet of Things (IoT) system that uses 2-state motion analysis to determine if a user has properly executed simple exercises (i.e. Russian twist, hip rises, sit ups). I developed the code for the project using C and the EmbeddedML Neural Network and ran the code on the STMicroelectronics SensorTile which hosts a STM32L4 microprocessor, accelerometer, and gyroscope as my IoT node.

My journey with this project was a difficult one as I ran into issues before I wrote a single line of code. When I attempted to connect the SensorTile to my laptop, it would not appear in device manager. With my limited knowledge in tech at the time, I had no idea what the issue was. I tried plugging in the SensorTile to different USB ports and even attempted connecting it to my desktop to see if it would detect. Nothing worked.

After some research and further experimentation, I concluded that the micro-USB cable I used to connect the SensorTile to my laptop was the issue. USB cables have two categories: charging cables and data cables. While most USB cables are charging cables, not all are data cables. Furthermore, with tech, there will always be defects every now and then. Such was the case with my cable. Although I bought a micro-USB cable that was capable of data transfer, the cable was not transferring data at all which resulted in the SensorTile not being detected in device manager. After I bought a non-faulty micro-USB cable, data transferred normally and the SensorTile was detected in device manager.

This little setback, although annoying, taught me a fair amount about USBs, USB ports, and USB/device compatibility. Before reaching the conclusion I mentioned above, I looked into how USB ports would fail. I learned about how dust can contribute to the buildup of static electricity that can completely bust a USB port. I also learned how some USB devices may not be fully compatible with certain USB ports or have other issues that can impact the port's performance. Furthermore, I learned about USB ports can get damaged by power surges or overloading when a device of poor quality or device demanding too much power gets plugged in.

But I digress. As I moved on to develop IoT motion detection functionality, I was overwhelmed by the sheer amount of starter code. It took me a few days to fully understand the codebase and understand what purpose each function served and how the program flowed. Once I understood the code well, I explored how the SensorTile's accelerometer and gyroscope worked. It was fun experimenting with various speed and rotation thresholds to see how motion detection got affected. Beyond messing with thresholds, I also played around with 2-state motion detection. After developing the code to facilitate 2-state motion detection, I modified whether the first and/or second state would utilize the accelerometer or gyroscope. I tested the various combinations to see which would yield the best performance when distinguishing simple exercises. Lastly, I modified the neural network to see how motion classification got affected. With an understanding of how certain modifications to the neural network would affect classification, I set parameters that would provide the best performance in distinguishing exercises from one another and determine whether the performed exercise was done properly. 

After much trial and error, I was able to develop IoT motion detection functionality and successfully developed an IoT node that can determine if a user has properly executed a simple exercise. I'm proud of this project as it was my first engineering project. It also opened the doors to many opportunities which have further advanced my career.

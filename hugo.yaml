    content: |-
      I am a 4th year undergraduate Computer Science and Engineering student in the [<u>Henry Samueli School of Engineering</u>](https://linkedin.com/in/trungvu08) at 
      [<u>UCLA</u>](https://www.ucla.edu/). I love computer science for its unlimited application potential and hope to leverage my skills to help forge a more equitable world.
      In my last year at UCLA, I hope to use my positions to make CS at UCLA more equitable and bring more companies to UCLA so our CS students have access to more opportunities.

      Currently, I am...
      - Interning at [<u>Sandia National Laboratories</u>](https://www.sandia.gov/)
      - Researching with [<u>Scalable Analytics Institute</u>](https://scai.cs.ucla.edu/)
      - Helping teach ENGR 96i in the Fall
      - External Vice President for [<u>Upsilon Pi Epsilon</u>](https://upe.seas.ucla.edu/)
      - Involved in the Southeast Asian space

      In my free time, I learn new languages/frameworks by working on various side projects (like this website) and dive deeper into Internet of Things.
      
      When I need a break from academics, I enjoy spending time with friends, trying food from different cultures, bowling, playing Valorant, learning to dance, and watching cooking videos.

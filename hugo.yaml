    content: |-
      I am a 4th year undergraduate Computer Science and Engineering student in the [<u>Henry Samueli School of Engineering</u>](https://linkedin.com/in/trungvu08) at 
      [<u>UCLA</u>](https://www.ucla.edu/). I love computer science for its unlimited application potential and hope to leverage my skills to help forge a more equitable world.
      In my last year at UCLA, I hope to use my positions to make CS at UCLA more equitable and bring more companies to UCLA so our CS students have access to more opportunities.

      Currently, I am...
      - Interning at [<u>Sandia National Laboratories</u>](https://www.sandia.gov/)
      - Researching with [<u>Scalable Analytics Institute</u>](https://scai.cs.ucla.edu/)
      - Helping teach ENGR 96i in the Fall
      - External Vice President for [<u>Upsilon Pi Epsilon</u>](https://upe.seas.ucla.edu/)
      - Involved in the Southeast Asian space

      In my free time, I learn new languages/frameworks by working on various side projects (like this website) and dive deeper into Internet of Things.
      
      When I need a break from academics, I enjoy spending time with friends, trying food from different cultures, bowling, playing Valorant, learning to dance, and watching cooking videos.

          I analyzed global and regional surface temperature anomalies of CMIP6 and Berkeley Earth data using machine learning with 
          Python to better understand global and regional warming trends. Using that understanding, I developed a deep neural network
          (DNN) using PyTorch to predict surface temperatures for the 21st century. I then organized an ensemble of the 16
          best climate project models and compared it with my DNN.

          This internship opportunity was achieved through [<u>UCLA's Joint Institute for Regional Earth and System Science & Engineering</u>](https://jifresse.ucla.edu/)
          (JIFRESSE) which is a scientific collaboration between UCLA and JPL. I encourage all those interested in tackling climate

          I'm working with graph neural networks (GNN) using PyTorch and DGL to uncover intrinsic patterns underlying unlabeled 
          protein sequence databases to assist in advanced property modeling. More specifically, I'm attempting to create an ML 
          model that can accurately detect methionine modification. The reason why I'm using GNNs is because, unlike typical ML 
          models, GNNs can take advantage of the structure of proteins and potentially yield more accurate prediction results.

          I assist Professor William Kaiser in teaching ENGR 96i: Internet of Things by teaching over 150 students how to program 
          in C, how the STM32L4 microprocessor on the  
          [<u>STMicroelectronics SensorTile</u>](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/steval-stlkt01v1.html#st_description_sec-nav-tab) works, 
          and how machine learning is performed via the EmbeddedML Neural Network. I do this to assist students in developing their 
          own IoT device with motion detection functionality using accelerometer and gyroscope data from the SensorTile.

          I also assist Professor Kaiser in teaching ENGR 96c: Cybernetics by tutoring students in robotic control systems and
          teaching students how to use MATLAB. I do to help guide students towards developing their own cybernetics projects.

          Outside the classroom, I am developing and testing learning modules using the 
          [<u>B-U585I-IOT02A IoT node</u>](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/b-u585i-iot02a.html#)  for future adaptation into the

          corporate, entrepreneurship, and publicity events for current and incoming UCLA computer science students. Some events
          I've organized or will organize are CS Townhall, CS Welcome Day, CS Career Fair, and Tech Talk with Jane Street.

          Something else I do is recruit companies into the Computer Science Department's affiliate system and act as liaison between

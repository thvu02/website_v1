as a summer Cybersecurity R&amp;D intern. For 10 weeks in Albuquerque, New Mexico, I worked on two projects: operational technology (OT) network activity analysis and browser exploits. For the first project, I used unsupervised machine learning (ML) techniques such as clustering and decision trees to pinpoint what traits constitute malicious MODBUS behavior. MODBUS is a communication protocol commonly used by OT devices. Taking that understanding, I attempted to write rules on Splunk that would automatically flag suspicious network activity and generate summary reports. For the second project, I first looked into a zero-day exploit called patch gapping that was used on Chromium to build a firm understanding of how Chromium&rsquo;s V8 Engine worked. From there, I proceeded to analyze HAR data to find browser exploit indicators and also worked to determine if browser isolation can protect users from zero-day exploits.</p><p>At the end of summer, I converted to a year-round Cybersecurity R&amp;D intern where I remotely continuing working on the OT project. I wanted to continue working on both projects, but year-round interns can only work on one project since Sandia wants interns to focus on school (rightfully so). At the moment, I&rsquo;m still working on the writing rules on Splunk to flag suspicious network activity. However, I&rsquo;m also taking up some additional responsibility as I get to work on writing Python scripts that aggregate Sandia&rsquo;s IT and OT device inventory datasets to provide enriched and more accesible device information for Sandia staff.</p><p>I can&rsquo;t provide more details about the work I do for security reasons. But, I&rsquo;d be more than happy to talk about living in Albuquerque and the Center for Cyber Defenders (CCD) internship program in general. Interning at Sandia is a great way to enter cybersecurity and I recommend those interested in the field to apply!</p></p></div></div><div class=accordion><button class=accordion-header data-accordion>

, my goal was to use a deep learning approach to reconstruct Earth&rsquo;s historical global warming rate and reliably predict its future trend using a combination of input features, including both natural and human-caused climate drivers. With a well-trained deep neural network (DNN), I was to reaffirm the ongoing warming acceleration and gain a reliable prediction of its future trend, which will give humanity an early alarm on when a “tipping point” in climate change will come.</p><p>To this end, I analyzed surface temperature anomalies from 1850-2021 using the Berkeley Earth dataset, determining that regional warming occurs at varying rates. I observed that the Arctic began increasing in temperature faster than other regions (Tropics, Antarctic) starting in 2010 and found papers discussing the Arctic amplification phenomenon to support this observation. With that discovery, I pivoted to analyze latitude-dependent surface temperature simulations from CMIP6 models to understand their behavior and reliability. I attempted to determine whether CMIP6 models emulated observed regional and globally warming trends and whether large variance existed between different CMIP6 models and their regional/global temperature projections. CMIP6 models were designed specifically by climate scientists to consider human and natural factors that will impact climate and use those to accurately project future climates. If CMIP6 models are reliable, they would be a great training dataset for the DNN.</p><p>Using CMIP6 data from ESGF, I determined there exists a large variance between different CMIP6 models and their regional/global temperature projections. Due to this, I analyzed 65 CMIP6 models to identify “best-performing” models based on regional and global surface temperature anomaly accuracy with observed data. From the analysis, I compiled a 16-model ensemble composed of “best-performing” CMIP6 models to have a strong training dataset for my DNN. To prove that the ensemble was worthy to use as a training dataset, I demonstrated that it performs relative to observational data globally and regionally. As a bonus, I also utilized the ensemble to project surface temperatures from 2015 to 2075 under various shared socio-economic pathways (SSP), highlighting the need and impact of immediate climate mitigation and adaptation.</p><p>With a strong training dataset, I developed a DNN using PyTorch and trained it using the ensemble to the point where it can affirm ongoing warming acceleration and predict when a 2.0-2.5°C warming (a “tipping point” in climate change) will occur. The work I produced from this internship allowed me to have the 2nd best presentation out of all other JSIP interns for our final presentations.</p><p>This internship opportunity was achieved through <a href=https://jifresse.ucla.edu/ target=_blank><u>UCLA&rsquo;s Joint Institute for Regional Earth and System Science & Engineering</u></a>
(JIFRESSE) which is a scientific collaboration between UCLA and JPL. I encourage all those interested in tackling climate change to explore this opportunity!</p></p></div></div><div class=accordion><button class=accordion-header data-accordion>

is a climate tech startup developing a web-portal that utilizes ArcGIS maps and WebXR to provide users an immersive augmented reality experience of assessing their property&rsquo;s flood risk and viewing their city&rsquo;s green and grey infrastructure. Their AI model is designed to predict flood risk for individual properties and visualize potential damage via 3D rendered maps of city infrastructure. This product will be useful for individual homeowners as well as officials as city planners implement flood mitigation strategies.</p><p>During my internship, I helped develop green and grey infrastructure maps for New Orleans, LA with ArcGIS API for JavaScript to improve the company&rsquo;s GIS database and disaster risk/mitigation method calculations. I also researched and implemented several IBM software, such as Watson Assistant, App Connect, Code Engine, and etc., into the product&rsquo;s system architecture. Furthermore, I played a key role in re-designing the company&rsquo;s website to intricately showcase the product and its underlying tech stack, enhancing the company&rsquo;s ability to appeal to both customers and investors. Lastly, I managed and maintained the company&rsquo;s code-base on GitHub using Git version control.</p><p>I enjoyed working at SISYPHUS because I got exposed to various pieces of technology and was doing something new almost every week. This is very different than working at a large, well-established company where you just stick to one or two things. Participating in various hackathons with the company, I got to explore various open-source software and figure out how to integrate each technology into the company&rsquo;s system architecture. Beyond this, working at a startup let me experience more than the engineering side of a company. I learned various entrepreneurial skills like competitive analysis, value chain analysis, identifying market-fit, etc. I also learned how LLC creation laws differed in each state and the pros/cons of claiming intellectual property in broad/specific manners. Lastly, working at SISYPHUS gave me personal satisfaction as I know the product I&rsquo;m helping develop is designed specifically to tackle the impending effects of climate change and the combat the systemically racist settlement patterns in American cities. Sadly, exploitation and gentrification have resulted in wealthy (mostly white) populations settling in geographically high-lying areas whilst low-income, minority populations are left to settle in low-lying areas with greater flood risk and less flood protection. While SISYPHUS&rsquo;s product will help everyone protect their properties from flood damage, the product will bring about some equity by providing underserved, low-income, minority communities with a free resource to protect their properties.</p></p></div></div><h2 id=other-employment>Other Employment</h2><hr><div class=accordion><button class=accordion-header data-accordion>

More specifically, I&rsquo;m attempting to create an ML model that can accurately detect methionine modification.

As a Group Tutor, I assist Professor William Kaiser in teaching over 150 students how to develop IoT motion detection functionality using the STMicroeletronics SensorTile and EmbeddedML Neural Network. More specifically, I teach students about C programming, the STM32L4 microprocessor on the <a href=https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/steval-stlkt01v1.html#st_description_sec-nav-tab target=_blank><u>STMicroelectronics SensorTile</u></a>
, and machine learning. This is to have them develop a solid foundation on which they can begin developing their own IoT motion detection device using the SensorTile&rsquo;s accelerometer and gyroscope. As students develop their own projects, I help them debug code and provide insight on how to expand the neural network to realize their project ideas.</p><p>Beyond Engineering 96i, I also assist Professor Kaiser in teaching Engineering 96c: Cybernetics by tutoring students in robotic control systems and teaching them how to use MATLAB. After giving students enough background knowledge, I guide them in developing their own cybernetics project. Unfortunately, this course isn&rsquo;t being offered anymore.</p><p>Outside the classroom, I am working to refine Engineering 96i. More specifically, I am reviewing the current tutorials being used for the course to identify points where clarity can be improved and patch inconsistencies. I am also compiling a comprehensive course guidebook with tutorial solutions and insightful hints that course instructors and Group Tutors can utilize to better and more easily help students. Furthermore, I am developing and testing learning modules using the <a href=https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/b-u585i-iot02a.html# target=_blank><u>B-U585I-IOT02A IoT node</u></a>
for future adaptation into the course since this IoT device will be replacing the SensorTile.</p><p>Joining the Engineering 96i teaching staff was one of the best decisions I&rsquo;ve made at UCLA as it allowed me to combine my passions of tech and service. Tutoring for multiple iterations of the course over the past 2 years, I feel great satisfaction helping students build their skillsets and develop projects they can highlight during interviews. Alongside teaching, I&rsquo;m proud of the technical accomplishments I&rsquo;ve made towards improving the course. Using the draft course guidebook I compiled over summer, the Group Tutors this fall quarter complimented on how it allowed them to better help students and quickly identify solutions to the issues students were facing. With the R&amp;D I&rsquo;m doing with the new IoT node, I hope to contribute major refinements to the course material so students at UCLA and other education institutions which use this material for their own IoT courses have an even better experience when taking the course.</p></p></div></div><div class=accordion><button class=accordion-header data-accordion>

as a summer Cybersecurity R&amp;D intern. For 10 weeks in Albuquerque, New Mexico, I worked on two projects: operational technology (OT) network activity analysis and browser exploits. For the first project, I used unsupervised learning techniques such as clustering and decision trees to pinpoint what traits constitute malicious MODBUS behavior. MODBUS is a communication protocol commonly used by OT devices. Taking that understanding, I attempted to write rules on Splunk that would automatically flag suspicious network activity and generate summary reports. For the second project, I first looked into a zero-day exploit called patch gapping that was used on Chromium to build a firm understanding of how Chromium&rsquo;s V8 Engine worked. From there, I proceeded to analyze HAR data to find browser exploit indicators and also worked to determine if browser isolation can protect users from zero-day exploits.</p><p>At the end of summer, I converted to a year-round Cybersecurity R&amp;D intern where I remotely continuing working on the OT project. I wanted to continue working on both projects, but year-round interns can only work on one project since Sandia wants interns to focus on school (rightfully so). At the moment, I&rsquo;m still working on the writing rules on Splunk to flag suspicious network activity. However, I&rsquo;m also taking up some additional responsibility as I get to work on writing Python scripts that aggregate Sandia&rsquo;s IT and OT device inventory datasets to provide enriched and more accesible device information for Sandia staff.</p><p>I can&rsquo;t provide more details about the work I do for security reasons. But, I&rsquo;d be more than happy to talk about living in Albuquerque and the Center for Cyber Defenders (CCD) internship program in general. Interning at Sandia is a great way to enter cybersecurity and I recommend those interested in the field to apply!</p></p></div></div><div class=accordion><button class=accordion-header data-accordion>

my goal was to use a deep learning approach to reconstruct Earth&rsquo;s historical global warming rate and reliably predict its future trend using a combination of input features, including both natural and human-caused climate drivers. With a well-trained deep neural network (DNN), I was to reaffirm the ongoing warming acceleration and gain a reliable prediction of its future trend, which will give humanity an early alarm on when a “tipping point” in climate change will come.</p><p>To this end, I analyzed surface temperature anomalies from 1850-2021 using the Berkeley Earth dataset, determining that regional warming occurs at varying rates. I observed that the Arctic began increasing in temperature faster than other regions (Tropics, Antarctic) starting in 2010 and found papers discussing the Arctic amplification phenomenon to support this observation. With that discovery, I pivoted to analyze latitude-dependent surface temperature simulations from CMIP6 models to understand their behavior and reliability. I attempted to determine whether CMIP6 models emulated observed regional and globally warming trends and whether large variance existed between different CMIP6 models and their regional/global temperature projections. CMIP6 models were designed specifically by climate scientists to consider human and natural factors that will impact climate and use those to accurately project future climates. If CMIP6 models are reliable, they would be a great training dataset for the DNN.</p><p>Using CMIP6 data from ESGF, I determined there exists a large variance between different CMIP6 models and their regional/global temperature projections. Due to this, I analyzed 65 CMIP6 models to identify “best-performing” models based on regional and global surface temperature anomaly accuracy with observed data. From the analysis, I compiled a 16-model ensemble composed of “best-performing” CMIP6 models to have a strong training dataset for my DNN. To prove that the ensemble was worthy to use as a training dataset, I demonstrated that it performs relative to observational data globally and regionally. As a bonus, I also utilized the ensemble to project surface temperatures from 2015 to 2075 under various shared socio-economic pathways (SSP), highlighting the need and impact of immediate climate mitigation and adaptation.</p><p>With a strong training dataset, I developed a DNN using PyTorch and trained it using the ensemble to the point where it can affirm ongoing warming acceleration and predict when a 2.0-2.5°C warming (a “tipping point” in climate change) will occur. The work I produced from this internship allowed me to have the 2nd best presentation out of all other JSIP interns for our final presentations.</p><p>This internship opportunity was achieved through <a href=https://jifresse.ucla.edu/ target=_blank><u>UCLA&rsquo;s Joint Institute for Regional Earth and System Science & Engineering</u></a>

is a climate tech startup developing a web-portal that utilizes ArcGIS maps and WebXR to provide users an immersive augmented reality experience of assessing their property&rsquo;s flood risk and viewing their city&rsquo;s green and grey infrastructure. Their AI model is designed to predict flood risk for individual properties and visualize potential damage via 3D rendered maps of city infrastructure. This product will be useful for individual homeowners as well as officials as city planners implement flood mitigation strategies.</p><p>During my internship, I helped develop green and grey infrastructure maps for New Orleans, LA with ArcGIS API for JavaScript to improve the company&rsquo;s GIS database and disaster risk/mitigation method calculations. I also researched and implemented several IBM software, such as Watson Assistant, App Connect, Code Engine, and etc., into the product&rsquo;s system architecture. Furthermore, I played a key role in re-designing the company&rsquo;s website to intricately showcase the product and its underlying tech stack, enhancing the company&rsquo;s ability to appeal to both customers and investors. Lastly, I managed and maintained the company&rsquo;s code-base on GitHub using Git version control.</p><p>I enjoyed working at SISYPHUS because I got exposed to various pieces of technology and was doing something new almost every week. This is very different than working at a large, well-established company where you just stick to one or two things. Participating in various hackathons with the company, I got to explore various open-source software and figure out how to integrate each technology into the company&rsquo;s system architecture. Beyond this, working at a startup let me experience more than the engineering side of a company. I learned various entrepreneurial skills like competitive analysis, value chain analysis, identifying market-fit, etc. I also learned how LLC creation laws differed in each state and the pros/cons of claiming intellectual property in broad/specific manners. Lastly, working at SISYPHUS gave me personal satisfaction as I know the product I&rsquo;m helping develop is designed specifically to tackle the impending effects of climate change and the combat the systemically racist settlement patterns in American cities. Sadly, exploitation and gentrification have resulted in wealthy (mostly white) populations settling in geographically high-lying areas whilst low-income, minority populations are left to settle in low-lying areas with greater flood risk and less flood protection. While SISYPHUS&rsquo;s product will help everyone protect their properties from flood damage, the product will bring about some equity by providing underserved, low-income, minority communities with a free resource to protect their properties.</p></p></div></div><h2 id=other-employment>Other Employment</h2><hr><div class=accordion><button class=accordion-header data-accordion>

(ScAI) is one of the research labs within the Computer Science Department at UCLA and is directed by Professor <a href=https://web.cs.ucla.edu/~weiwang/ target=_blank>Wei Wang.</a>
The lab covers multiple areas of research, but I&rsquo;m specifically working on Graph-based Analytics for biomedicine.</p><p>Bioconjugation chemistries are generally designed to be chemoselective and thus react only with a select amino acid side chain types. However, when multiple copies of the same residue type are present on a protein, their relative reactivities, site selectivity, is governed by the local microenvironment surrounding each site. Predicting site selectivity of bioconjugation reagents for a given protein is an outstanding challenge which the UCLA ScAI lab and UC Berkeley Toste Lab aim to address.</p><p>My research is on applying graph neural networks (GNN) to predict protein site modification. The goal is to develop a GNN that can reliably predict protein modification status. The reason why I&rsquo;m using GNNs is because, unlike typical ML models, GNNs can take advantage of the structural properties of proteins and potentially yield more accurate prediction results.</p><p>Given protein data compiled by UC Berkeley&rsquo;s Toste, I needed to convert the data into a graphical structure so it can be fed into the GNN. To do this, I represented each amino acid in a protein as a node containing features such as the amino acid’s bespoke descriptors and three-dimensional structure. I then scaled these features to ensure one feature does not have greater influence over others when fed into the GNN. Since features such as “atom element” are composed of categorical values, they are one-hot encoded to prevent unintentional ordinal bias. After all of that, I used the raw three dimensional structure data of each amino acid to draw edges between nodes within 8 angstroms of one another. The justification behind choosing 8 as this threshold stems from the results of papers using other thresholds. After this process is done for each protein, I saved the information to a binary file so this computation does not have to be done again and now have a dataset that can be fed into the GNN. To speed up the preprocessing of the protein data, I used the joblib library to utilize multiprocessing. This was necessary as some protein data provided by the Toste Lab would have taken over 25 labs to completely process (this is an optimistic estimate). With multiprocessing, the process was still long, but shortened to 1.0-2.5 days.</p><p>I developed the GNN using Deep Graph Library (DGL). The GNN is composed of 3-layers with a sigmoid activation function for each hidden layer. Taking the produced graphs, I did an 80/20 split to use 80% of the dataset for training the GNN and the remaining 20% for testing. Furthermore, to increase computational efficiency and generalization, I performed batching on the graphs in the training and testing datasets. Batching is a technique where sample graphs are combined into a single, bigger, batched graph. The resulting graph is a merge of all the sample graphs as separately connected components without losing any of the information held within each sample graph. I organized the graphs in the training and testing datasets in batches of 20. With the training and testing data prepared and the GNN developed, I proceeded to train the GNN.</p><p>The training loop of the GNN iterates over all the batched graphs for 20 epochs. My loss function only considers the amino acid of interest (methionine or tryptophan) and I used the AdamW optimizer to update the model parameters. After the GNN is trained, I ran the test dataset through the model and output performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score to evaluate its performance.</p><p>Preliminary results dictated that the GNN is not able to effectively predict site selectivity of bioconjugation reagents. However, modifying certain parameters like angstrom threshold, number of GNN layers, activation functions, batch size, and optimizers can potentially yield better performance metrics. This is what I&rsquo;m working on right now. It is clear though that the GNN is suffering from an imbalanced dataset since the ratio of modified amino acids to unmodified amino acids is extremely skewed. Of course, the dataset can be artificially balanced, but then that doesn&rsquo;t create a realistic environment since in real life, we don&rsquo;t expect to see many (if any) amino acids modified per protein. Therefore, I am currently working with Toste Lab to see if more feature information can be provided in the raw dataset, so the GNN has more data to utilize.

As a Group Tutor, I assist Professor William Kaiser in teaching over 150 students how to develop IoT motion detection functionality using the STMicroeletronics SensorTile and EmbeddedML Neural Network. More specifically, I teach students about C programming, the STM32L4 microprocessor on the <a href=https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/steval-stlkt01v1.html#st_description_sec-nav-tab target=_blank><u>STMicroelectronics SensorTile,</u></a>
and machine learning. This is to have them develop a solid foundation on which they can begin developing their own IoT motion detection device using the SensorTile&rsquo;s accelerometer and gyroscope. As students develop their own projects, I help them debug code and provide insight on how to expand the neural network to realize their project ideas.</p><p>Beyond Engineering 96i, I also assist Professor Kaiser in teaching Engineering 96c: Cybernetics by tutoring students in robotic control systems and teaching them how to use MATLAB. After giving students enough background knowledge, I guide them in developing their own cybernetics project. Unfortunately, this course isn&rsquo;t being offered anymore.</p><p>Outside the classroom, I am working to refine Engineering 96i. More specifically, I am reviewing the current tutorials being used for the course to identify points where clarity can be improved and patch inconsistencies. I am also compiling a comprehensive course guidebook with tutorial solutions and insightful hints that course instructors and Group Tutors can utilize to better and more easily help students. Furthermore, I am developing and testing learning modules using the <a href=https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/b-u585i-iot02a.html# target=_blank><u>B-U585I-IOT02A IoT node</u></a>
for future adaptation into the course since this IoT device will be replacing the SensorTile.</p><p>Joining the Engineering 96i teaching staff was one of the best decisions I&rsquo;ve made at UCLA as it allowed me to combine my passions of tech and service. Tutoring for multiple iterations of the course over the past 2 years, I feel great satisfaction helping students build their skillsets and develop projects they can highlight during interviews. Alongside teaching, I&rsquo;m proud of the technical accomplishments I&rsquo;ve made towards improving the course. Using the draft course guidebook I compiled over summer, the Group Tutors this fall quarter complimented on how it allowed them to better help students and quickly identify solutions to the issues students were facing. With the R&amp;D I&rsquo;m doing with the new IoT node, I hope to contribute major refinements to the course material so students at UCLA and other education institutions which use this material for their own IoT courses have an even better experience when taking the course.</p></p></div></div><div class=accordion><button class=accordion-header data-accordion>

(TMP) is a week-long program designed to improve the leadership and management skills of aspiring and current technical managers in industry. This is done through a variety of workshops which help managers gain leadership skills, enrich interpersonal skills, and discover a library of methods to resolve issues, plan effectively, and motivate staff members.</p><p>I became an Instructor Aide for the program to make some quick cash over spring break since I wasn&rsquo;t doing anything anyways, but the positions got filled up, so I was given a position for the fall iteration of the program.</p><p>As a Instructor Aide, I worked alongside 5 other aides to assist office staff and instructors in facilitating leadership and management workshops for over 130 technical managers from companies such as Blizzard, Credit Karma, Sandia National Laboratories, and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories. The days were long and hard. It wasn&rsquo;t your typical CS job where you sit in a chair, think, and write code all day. I was moving around doing print jobs, setting up banners, etc. But I got to participate in the workshops I TA-ed for and engage with the managers in various activities and exercises, so that&rsquo;s a plus.</p><p>Naturally, my position had me working with the TMP organizers which consisted of Joon Lee, Gina Springer, and Nicole Lim. While I understood that Joon was my boss, the work dynamic felt more like a nephew working with his cool uncle. I had great conversations with Joon as well as Gina and Nicole, and they were all very kind and understanding. Dr. William Goodin would sometimes stop by as well since he was the previous director of the program. It was great getting to talk and joke around with him as I work with Dr. Goodin as EVP for UPE, but never got to interact with him much through that position. As TMP progressed, I got to engage with Dr. Goodin and built a strong working relationship with him. We discussed UPE objectives, but also talked about more casual topics such as the food or his unique set of UCLA themed ties.</p><p>Speaking of food, the catering for TMP was amazing! I was excited for every single meal and enjoyed everything I got served. I remember raving about the bacon the most as it was different each day. I ranked the bacon quality each day and even had a passionate debate with the other Instructor Aides about which bacon was best. By the end of TMP, I think everyone knew I loved bacon.</p><p>Beyond food, TMP was great in that I developed connections with the technical managers and got referrals from them. Furthermore, my time with TMP brought to light my growth as a leader. On the last day of the program, I remember Joon saying that I was like the leader of the Instructor Aides. He said that I initially seemed shy, but he saw me become more open as the program progressed and how the other Instructor Aides sort of followed and looked up to me. I didn&rsquo;t expect to hear this. Even though I hold multiple leadership positions, I never saw myself as a leader. I felt that me and the other Instructor Aides were all equals. It never felt as if I was the one leading or being looked up to. Hearing that compliment from Joon boosted my confidence and belief that I can be a strong leader. Also, I think not realizing this fact is also a good thing because I don&rsquo;t want to be a leader that stands above my team. Instead, I want to be a leader that stands alongside my team and promotes a positive, friendly working environment.</p><p>Wrapping all this up, TMP is a wonderful program and being an Instructor Aide for this program is a great opportunity to network with technical managers across various industries and develop leadership skills.</p></p></div></div><div class=accordion><button class=accordion-header data-accordion>
